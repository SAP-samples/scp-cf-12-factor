# cf-12-factor
_forked from B1SA/cfDemoSummit18_

## Description  
Sample [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/) showing a scalable, resilient, ERP Agnostic, Loosely Coupled Architecture. This application works with both B1 and ByD.
It also shows how to implement a persistence (PostgreSQL) and Cache (Redis) layers. These backing services are optional for the app to run, but extremely recommended.

This application can be deployed also on a [Local Machine (for development purposes)](README-local.md)

A full webinar presenting the 12 factors and how this app implements them is available to SAP Partners: [Part 1](https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/MeesDe4?ltr=v&) and [Part 2](https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/eFVVjpn?)
